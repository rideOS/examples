    "# Constraints Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the *Path API* in conjunction with the *Constraint Data API*. First, we walk through the code and some simple examples. Then, we put it all together to show how you could use this technology to produce routes that respect the operational constraints of an autonomous or human fleet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We support specifying the following constraint types, grouped into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid constraints:\n",
    "- **Avoid Area**: Vehicles will avoid all road segments that intersect this polygon.\n",
    "- **Avoid Path**: Vehicles will avoid all road segments that are covered by this path.\n",
    "- **Avoid Turn**: Vehicles will avoid the turn indicated by this path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operational constraints:\n",
    "- **Operational Area**: Vehicles will be allowed to use roads that intersect this polygon.\n",
    "- **Operational Path**: Vehicles will be allowed to use roads that are covered by this path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these we can implement the following concepts for operating a fleet:\n",
    "- **Operational Domain (OD)**: Expressed through operational contraints (e.g. *Operational Path* and *Operational Area*)\n",
    "    - *e.g. Company XYZ is still developing their AV hardware and software, so they limit the operational domain to a network of roads throughout that city that are strategic and feasible. These roads can be identified via Operational Path constraints.*\n",
    "- **Operational Design Domain (ODD)**: Expressed through avoid constraints (e.g. *Avoid Turn*)\n",
    "    - *e.g. Company XYZ must limit operations even further inside their operational domain based on the capabilities which their vehicles are currently able to handle. For example, they currently must avoid all unprotected left turns (UPLs) for safety reasons. These turns can be identified via Avoid Turn constraints.*\n",
    "- **Keep Out Zones (KOZs)**: Expressed through avoid constraints (e.g. *Avoid Area* and *Avoid Path*)\n",
    "    - *e.g. Company XYZ must dynamically adapt to events like parades, street festivals, and construction which restricts travel along roads within their operational domain. These areas can be identified via Avoid Area constraints and be dynamically updated as frequently as necessary.*\n",
